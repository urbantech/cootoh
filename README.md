## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (>= 6.x)
- MongoDB (>= 4.x)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cootoh.git
cd cootoh
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required npm packages:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project Locally

### Start MongoDB
Ensure that MongoDB is running on your local machine. By default, the project connects to a MongoDB instance running on `localhost:27017`.

### Run the Server
To start the server in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command will start the Express server on the specified port (default: 3000).

### Run the Client
Navigate to the `client` directory to start the React front-end:
```bash
cd src/client
npm install
npm start
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory to set up environment variables:
```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cootoh
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

## Coding Standards

### Workflow and Branching
1. All work starts and ends with a Pivotal Tracker story.
2. Use feature branches for new work:
   - `feature/{story-id}`
   - `bug/{story-id}`
   - `chore/{story-id}`
3. Follow the workflow:
   - Write failing tests first (TDD).
   - Implement the functionality.
   - Refactor and ensure all tests pass.

### Naming Conventions
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions.
- Use `PascalCase` for classes and components.
- Name branches descriptively.

### Code Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Limit line length to 80 characters.
- Ensure meaningful comments are added to complex logic.

### Testing
- Use Jest and Supertest for unit and integration tests.
- Organize tests using `describe` and `it` blocks.
- Follow the Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) pattern:
  - **Arrange**: Set up test data.
  - **Act**: Perform the operation.
  - **Assert**: Verify the outcome.

### Pull Requests
- Submit pull requests with a clear description of changes.
- Ensure all tests pass before creating a PR.
- Break down work into small, focused commits.
- Mark pull requests as "WIP" (Work In Progress) if not ready for review.

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, concise commit messages.
- Prefix with the purpose:
  - `feat:`
  - `fix:`
  - `chore:`
  - `test:`
  - `refactor:`

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Make your changes and add tests.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
6. Create a pull request.

## Testing
Run tests using:
```bash
npm test
```

Run specific test files:
```bash
npx jest src/tests/yourTestFile.test.js
```
